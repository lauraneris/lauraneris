# My Personal Portfolio

This is the repository of my personal portfolio website, where I share information about myself, my projects, and my skills as a developer.

## Overview

This website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes the following sections:

- About Me: Currently, I am a Software Engineering student at Positivo University and aim to gain experiences and knowledge in this field. Additionally, I hold certifications in JAVA and Python from the Codecademy platform.
Previously, I studied Medicine at City University of SÃ£o Paulo, where I gained significant professional experiences in the healthcare field. I participated in scientific initiation projects, including studies on genomic stability, molecular biology, and cancer development, as well as volunteered for activities like the "Doctors on the streets" project.

Despite spending a year in the medical program and acquiring a solid proficiency, I decided to transition into programming due to personal and professional interests and goals.

- Projects: In addition to university internships in the medical field, I currently work temporarily as a Barista at The Coffee, a food and beverage company. In this role, I was able to enhance my interpersonal relationship skills with teammates and customers, as well as acquire knowledge about coffee and bartending techniques.

I also engage in practical programming, applying the knowledge gained from Codecademy and university courses in programming and computer architecture. This experience has provided me with ease, agility, and dedication to learning new requests and developing code and programs.

- Skills: I possess communication skills, teamwork, objectivity, focus, attention to detail, rapid learning ability, logical reasoning, empathy, and highly proactive nature.
