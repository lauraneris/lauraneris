Portfolio README

Professional Objective


I am currently a Software Engineering student at Positivo University, seeking to gain experiences and knowledge in this field. Furthermore, I have certifications in JAVA and Python from the Codecademy platform.

Education


Previously, I pursued Medicine at City University of SÃ£o Paulo, where I acquired significant professional experiences in the healthcare sector. I participated in scientific initiation projects, focusing on genomic stability, molecular biology, and cancer development. Additionally, I volunteered for activities such as the "Doctors on the streets" project.

Despite spending a year in the medical program and achieving a solid proficiency, I decided to transition into programming due to personal and professional interests and goals.

Professional Experience


Apart from university internships in the medical field, I currently hold a temporary position as a Barista at The Coffee, a food and beverage company. In this role, I honed my interpersonal relationship skills with teammates and customers while also gaining knowledge about coffee and bartending techniques.

Furthermore, I actively engage in practical programming, applying the knowledge acquired from Codecademy and university courses in programming and computer architecture. This experience has equipped me with the ability to swiftly learn new concepts and develop code and programs.

Skills


I possess a diverse set of skills including communication, teamwork, objectivity, focus, attention to detail, rapid learning ability, logical reasoning, empathy, and a highly proactive nature.
